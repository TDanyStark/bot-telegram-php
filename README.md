 ## How Works:

* this bot have 2 commands:

1. /c <valor> EXAMPLE: /c 100
 Once this value is entered, it is registered in the database with your chat_id (You can register as much data as you want)
 When a user registers a value, the date is automatically saved.
 
 2. /sumar <fecha_inicio> <fecha_final> EXAMPLE: /sumar 2023-01-01 2023-12-31
In other words, the date format is YYYY-MM-DD. This command performs a search in the database and returns the sum of all the values on the specified dates.
